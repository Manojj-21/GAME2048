**Air Quality Monitoring System**

This project is an Air Pollution Monitoring System that tracks environmental air quality in real-time. Utilizing various gas sensors, the system detects harmful gases such as CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3, displays the air quality index on an LCD and automatically triggers an alarm when Estimated Aqi(Air Quality index) value is reached.



Features

1. Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously measures concentrations of gas in near the Sensor.



2\. Threshold Alerts: Sounds an alarm when quality levels exceed safe limits.



3\. Display: Air quality readings shown on both a local LCD.



4\. Remote Access: Enables monitoring from any internet-connected device for timely awareness.



Technologies Used

1. Microcontroller: Arduino Nano



2\. Sensors: MQ-series for CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and ammonia LCD Display



3\. Buzzer/Alarm Module



Programming Languages: C/C++ (for microcontroller), JavaScript/HTML (for web dashboard)



How It Works

1. Sensors read current levels of various gases in PPM.



2\. Readings are displayed on the LCD for local monitoring.



3\. If any aqi value exceeds its safety threshold, an alarm is triggered.
